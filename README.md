# vending-machine-web-app



This is an incomplete vending machine web app.
The app is mainly split into 2 parts: The vending machine app itself and a simple interface to simulate using a vending machine. At this moment  the interface is built into the app so it will take some more work to change the simulation with something better suited.

Incomplete features:
A heating and cooling system needs to be implemented.
Anti scam measures need to be implemented. I believe security could be done more easily on backend side, Unfortunately, the way I coded the project, it makes no API calls, and needs to be heavily modified.
An inventory for items need to be implemented. 
Energy calculation and saving needs to be implemented.
A timer needs to be implemented
